        Cross platform#
        VS Code is a free code editor, which runs on the macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems.
       
        VS Code is lightweight and should run on most available hardware and platform versions. You can review the System Requirements to check if your computer configuration is supported.
        
        Update cadence#
        VS Code releases a new version each month with new features and important bug fixes. Most platforms support auto updating and you will be prompted to install the new release when it becomes available. You can also manually check for updates by running Help > Check for Updates on Linux and Windows or running Code > Check for Updates on macOS.
        
        Note: You can disable auto-update if you prefer to update VS Code on your own schedule.
        
        Insiders nightly build#
        If you'd like to try our nightly builds to see new features early or verify bug fixes, you can install our Insiders build. The Insiders build installs side-by-side with the monthly Stable build and you can freely work with either on the same machine. The Insiders build is the same one the VS Code development team uses on a daily basis and we really appreciate people trying out new features and providing feedback.
        
        Portable mode#
        Visual Studio Code supports Portable mode installation. This mode enables all data created and maintained by VS Code to live near itself, so it can be moved around across environments, for example, on a USB drive. See the VS Code Portable Mode documentation for details.
        
        Additional components#
        VS Code is an editor, first and foremost, and prides itself on a small footprint. Unlike traditional IDEs that tend to include everything but the kitchen sink, you can tune your installation to the development technologies you care about. Be sure to read the Additional Components topic after reading the platform guides to learn about customizing your VS Code installation.
        
        Extensions#
        VS Code extensions let third parties add support for additional:
        
        Languages - C++, C#, Go, Java, Python
        Tools - ESLint, JSHint , PowerShell
        Debuggers - PHP XDebug.
        Keymaps - Vim, Sublime Text, IntelliJ, Emacs, Atom, Brackets, Visual Studio, Eclipse
        Extensions integrate into VS Code's UI, commands, and task running systems so you'll find it easy to work with different technologies through VS Code's shared interface. Check out the VS Code extension Marketplace to see what's available.

The console screen is used by devs to give notes on the code screen popup.
A console traditionally refers to a computer terminal where a user may input commands and view output such as the results of inputted commands or status messages from the computer. 
The console is often connected to a remote computer or computer system that is controlled from the console.
